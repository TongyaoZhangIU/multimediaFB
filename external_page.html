      <h3>What will happen during the study?</h3>
    If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things: </br>
  You will be seated at a computer.  You will be presented with several straightforward tasks to complete.  These tasks will include responding with key strokes to stimuli (e.g., images, videos, words, or sounds) presented on the computer and may involve learning what categories objects (including sound objects) belong in, determining if objects are identical or related, or remembering or transferring what you learn about objects in one training task to a related task.  If the  experiment lasts for 30 minutes to 60 minutes, then this single session is the entire participation duration.  If the experiments lasts for 120 minutes, then this session will last for a maximum of 60 minutes, and a single follow-up session will also last for a maximum of 60 minutes.  If you are participating in the experiment in our laboratory, then you will participate in the experiment within a private cubicle in the Geology Building of Indiana University.
        If you are participating in the experiment online, then you can participate wherever you wish. </br>
